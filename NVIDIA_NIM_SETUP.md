# NVIDIA NIM Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you integrate NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) into your Zoom clone application for enhanced AI-powered captions, meeting summaries, and action item extraction.

## Prerequisites

1. **NVIDIA NIM Account & API Access**
   - Sign up for NVIDIA AI Foundation Models
   - Get your NIM API key from the NVIDIA Developer Portal
   - Ensure you have access to the required models:
     - Speech-to-Text: `nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1.1b` or similar ASR model
     - LLM: `meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` or other chat models

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
   - Next.js 14+ (already installed)
   - HTTPS development environment (required for speech recognition)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your NVIDIA NIM credentials:

```bash
# NVIDIA NIM Configuration
NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY=your-actual-nvidia-nim-api-key-here
NVIDIA_NIM_BASE_URL=https://api.nvcf.nvidia.com/v2/nvcf
NVIDIA_ASR_NIM_URL=https://api.nvcf.nvidia.com/v2/nvcf/pexels/functions
NVIDIA_LLM_NIM_URL=https://api.nvcf.nvidia.com/v2/nvcf/pexels/functions
NVIDIA_ASR_MODEL=nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1.1b
NVIDIA_LLM_MODEL=meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start with HTTPS enabled (required for speech recognition).

### 3. Test the Integration

1. **Navigate to Captions Page**
   - Go to `https://localhost:3000/captions`
   - You should see the new NVIDIA AI-Enhanced Captions interface

2. **Test Live Captions**
   - Click "Start Recording" to begin speech recognition
   - Speak into your microphone
   - Watch for captions to appear and get enhanced by NVIDIA NIM

3. **Test AI Features**
   - Enable "AI Enhancement" in the settings panel
   - Generate a meeting summary using the "Generate Summary" button
   - Extract action items using the "Extract Action Items" button

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Live Captions
- **Real-time speech recognition** using browser WebSpeech API
- **AI enhancement** of captions using NVIDIA NIM LLMs
- **Context-aware improvements** with conversation history
- **Confidence scoring** and processing status indicators

### 2. Meeting Summarization
- **Automatic summary generation** when meetings end
- **Manual summary creation** with customizable prompts
- **Professional formatting** suitable for sharing with stakeholders
- **Export functionality** for summaries

### 3. Action Item Extraction
- **Intelligent identification** of tasks and next steps
- **Responsible party assignment** when mentioned
- **Structured output** with numbered lists
- **Easy copying and sharing**

### 4. Settings & Customization
- **Toggle AI enhancement** on/off
- **Confidence threshold** adjustment
- **Context awareness** settings
- **Auto-processing** options

## API Endpoints

The integration includes the following API routes:

- `POST /api/nvidia-nim/speech-to-text` - Convert audio to text
- `POST /api/nvidia-nim/enhance-captions` - Enhance raw captions
- `POST /api/nvidia-nim/summarize` - Generate summaries and extract action items

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"NVIDIA NIM API key is required" Error**
   - Ensure your `.env.local` file contains a valid `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY`
   - Restart your development server after adding the key

2. **Speech Recognition Not Working**
   - Ensure you're using HTTPS (localhost should work automatically)
   - Check browser permissions for microphone access
   - Verify you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

3. **AI Enhancement Not Working**
   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Verify your NVIDIA NIM API key has access to the required models
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits/quota

4. **Network/CORS Issues**
   - NIM API calls are made server-side to avoid CORS issues
   - Check that your server can reach the NVIDIA NIM endpoints

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your `.env.local`:

```bash
DEBUG=nvidia-nim*
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with shorter conversations to test the integration
2. **Check Confidence**: Monitor confidence scores to tune the enhancement threshold
3. **Review Summaries**: AI-generated content should be reviewed before sharing
4. **Save Sessions**: Use the download feature to save important meeting data

## Cost Optimization

- Use confidence thresholds to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Enable "Enhance Only Final Captions" to avoid processing interim results
- Consider auto-processing settings based on meeting importance

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Models**: Experiment with different NIM models for your use case
2. **Add More Features**: Consider sentiment analysis, topic extraction, or speaker identification
3. **Integration**: Connect with calendar systems or CRM platforms
4. **Mobile Support**: Extend the integration to mobile devices
